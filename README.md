### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abhishek.


Iâ€™m currently working on Flutter, and learning the basics so I can launch my website, Shekwrites as a app.
 Iâ€™m currently learning Go, and hoping to relearn SQL because I forgot:(
 Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any websites or small projects.
 Iâ€™m looking for help with JS/React/Node.  
 Ask me about HTML and CSS or C / C++, I might be able to help you with those.
 How to reach me: Discord: probcodingorwatchingtheofficeUS#1158 or Email: nintendo.spy123@gmail.com.
Have fun looking around my repos, and reach out to me if you want to collaborate or create a pull request.
I know the basics of JS, along with HTML/CSS, Python, C and C++.
