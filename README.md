### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abhishek.


 Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS(as well as GO), and hoping to relearn SQL because I forgot:(
 Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any websites or small projects.
 Iâ€™m looking for help with Node.js. 
 <br></br>
 Ask me about HTML and CSS or C / C++, I might be able to help you with those.
 How to reach me: 
 <br></br>
 Discord: probcodingorwatchingtheofficeUS#1158 or Email: nintendo.spy123@gmail.com.
 <br></br>
Have fun looking around my repos, and reach out to me if you want to collaborate or create a pull request.
I know JS, along with HTML/CSS, Python, C and C++.
<br></br>
I have taken Harvard's CS50x as well.
